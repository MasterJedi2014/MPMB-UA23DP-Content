# MPMB-UA23DP-Content
This script adds the **Find Familiar** spell, its associated "Otherworldly Familiar" creature, and the Epic Boon Feats from the *Unearthed Arcana 2023: Druid & Paladin* article to the MPMB character sheet.

More specifically, this script adds the *UA23DP* version of the **Find Familiar** spell, a CompanionList menu option for the *UA23DP* **Find Familiar** spell, a version of the "Otherworldly Familiar" creature for each spell level, the "Otherworldly Familiar" creature's "Otherworldly Scratch" attack, & the three Epic Boon Feats. This encompasses all of the content in this UA article that wasn't superseded or removed in later content.

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the upcoming revision to D&D 5E.
